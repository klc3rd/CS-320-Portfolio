In order to ensure a program is secure and functional, the first thing that is needed is proper design. Proper design starts with reviewing program requirements, primarily at the start, but all throughout the development process. What sort of things needing to be tested also need to be decided on early in the process.

Multiple people should be involved in the testing process, as there is a bias by the developers of the software. Having a dedicated testing team is a good way to ensure the software is properly tested. Requirements should also be frequently reviewed. Between each iteration and as often as between each sprint, requirements should be reviewed, and features decided upon.

Software design should be an iterative, agile approach. In this way planning happens primarily at the start but also continuous throughout the process. Changes can be made if needed throughout the process, allowing for unpredictability as clients frequently change their minds or issues may arise.
